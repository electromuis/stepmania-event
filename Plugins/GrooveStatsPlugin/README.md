# GrooveStatsPlugin

Plugin written to simulate the gslauncher (https://github.com/GrooveStats/gslauncher#readme)

With this plugin enabled you will be able to use the online In The Groove score system called GrooveStats (https://groovestats.com/)
Currently this is only supported when running an up-to-date version of Simply Love (https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5)

This plugin must be used with the [PluginManager](../README.md)
